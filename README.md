Sample Oracle Database 

# Coursework Project 
Iâ€™ve created this project as a term paper defense. It shows a sample Oracle Database named Equestrian, reached through SQL Developer. 
It describes and reflects the process of holding Horse Race Tournaments and Competitions according to the Equestrian Federation.
Any suggestions for improvements will be appreciated!
